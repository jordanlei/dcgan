# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
Implementation of DCGAN. Work in progress.

The code is largely based off of the work done by [@eriklindernoren](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN) and the [DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) by Radford et al. This repository's main purpose is experimentation with DCGANs. 

## DCGAN implementation on MNIST dataset
Below is an implementation of a DCGAN on the MNIST dataset, trained on 8000 steps:

## DCGAN implementation on CIFAR dataset
In progress.
