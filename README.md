# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks
Implementation of DCGAN. Work in progress.

The code is largely based off of the work done by [@eriklindernoren](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN) and the [DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) by Radford et al. This repository's main purpose is experimentation with DCGANs.
